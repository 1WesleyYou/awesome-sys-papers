### Related SOTA work

<!-- SOTA Review
    First part of the Introduction, may also include related work section (near last part) -> look for dense reference paragraphs
-->

- What are the state-of-the-art solutions addressing this problem?
  - the Multics time sharing system
  - Dijkstra's THE system
- Why they are inadequate?
  <!-- SOTA Frame Name: shortback -->
  - The simplicity, elegance and easy of use are not enough
  - Feature richness and flexibility are not sufficient

### Idea & insight

<!-- Idea & Insight: Second part of the Introduction
    Second part of Intro will show the tools/algos the work uses (the insights, background principles of their work but not the implementation, which is the third part)
-->

- What is the key idea of this work?
  <!-- Tool/Algo name: function statement -->
  - Design of a time-sharing system UNIX, with brand new design of file system
- What is the insight, if any, behind this idea?
  <!-- Insight: background principles, why it works -->
  - Filesystem: the hierarchical file system with directory could manage the disk more efficiently.
  - Unified peripheral device management: treating all devices as files simplifies I/O operations.
  - Files are byte streams.
- Why _might_ this idea be better than prior work?
  <!-- Innovation of the insight, it's the combination of "SOTA shortback" and "Idea & Insight" -->
  - The hierarchical file system design with inode is more efficient and powerful, namely the files with folders can be easily organized and accessed.
  - The unified approach to device management simplifies the I/O model and supports security protection of external device just as internal files.
  - The byte stream model for files and descriptors simplifies the I/O operations and makes it easier to program.

### Solution

<!-- Solution: it should be found in the Method/Design section
    For the design overview in the Intro part, it's too general, but in Design section it should be concrete enough.
    It's very important to read the flow chart/diagrams in this section, usually the solutions are presented visually.
-->

- Roughly speaking, how does the solution work?
  <!-- read the figure (flow chart) -->
  - The solution provides the global design of the UNIX system, which includes the hierarchical file system, process management model, I/O model, and shell design. All these components combined together as a good system model.
- What are the key techniques and algorithms used in the solution?
  <!-- read the bullet point/bold text in the introduction, they should be listed as keywords there -->
  - Hierarchical file system with tree structure
  - Process management (fork, exec, pipe) with virtual memory
  - I/O model (device files, byte streams, mount) with unified view

### Assumption & limitations

<!-- Assumption keyword:
    1. we believe ...
    2. suppose
    3. assume
    4. suggest
-->

<!-- Limitation keyword:
    1. restrict
    2. consider
    3. focus on
    4. ignore
    5. limit
    6. model
-->

- What assumptions do the proposed solution make?
  - Unified view of files and devices
  - Byte stream model for files and I/O operations
  - Models should be interactive
- Are these assumptions reasonable? Are there any assumption that the authors did not describe in the paper?
  - Reasonable.
- What limitations does this solution have?
  - System is on PDP-11/40 and 11/45 machines, but not tested on other hardwares.

### Effectiveness

<!-- Evaluation Section and Related Work
    1. Evaluation:
      - Setup: datasets, metrics, baselines
    2. Analysis:
      - Result back up the hypothesis
      - Error analysis, etc.
-->

- What experiments, analyses are conducted to evaluate the solution?
  <!-- setup, eval method (data process) -->
  - The paper includes statistics about every field related to this system, including user, file/directory capacities, blocks used and CPU/resource/time usage. Also there's access pattern analysis.
- Do these results and analyses back up the paper's claims?
  - These results support the paper's idea of such a time-sharing system is practical and efficient.
- Are there any missing aspects in the evaluation?
  <!-- Consider robustness, end-to-end, scalability test -->
  - Actually there's no common evaluation framework for such systems, making it hard to compare with others.

### Comparison

- How does this work compare with some other works we have read/discussed?
  <!-- Consider the SOTA in the prev part, but here compare with result data -->
  - Multics system: the authors says that UNIX learnt a lot from Multics, like the form of the I/O system calls and shell with its designs.
- Does it take a radically different approach or draw a surprising conclusion?
  - No. The conclusion is promising with its amazing design.
- Or is it more or less in line with the direction in the other works?
  - Yes. It aligns well with the idea to create a more efficient and user/coder-friendly and small size time-sharing operating system.

### Learning & thoughts

- Are you convinced that the proposed idea/solution is good?
  - Yes. Many ideas like the inode, hierarchical file system, process management (pipe, fork, exec) are still used in today's MacOS and Linux systems.
- If not, what **flaws** you see in the work that can be improved?
  - N/A
- What are the new things you learned from this paper?
  - The design idea behind the UNIX file system, including the use of inodes and a hierarchical directory structure.
  - The unified approach for system design, like treating all devices as files.
  - The concept of byte stream for all IO operations.

### Unanswered questions

- What questions are you left with?
  - What's the difference btw the UNIX and Linux in terms of file system and process management?
- Are there any confusing parts of the paper that are not addressed?
  - N/A
- If you were the authors, is there anything you would do differently?
  - Add more testing details to illustrate the powerful features of the system. Or test it on other machine like the THE system/Multics.

### Historical papers only

- What historical context (e.g., hardware trend) was the work in?
  - The UNIX system has its 2 prev versions, and this is the third iteration.
  - Hardware was PDP 11/40 and 11/15 computers, running which costs little at that time
- What things you were taking for granted but now understand how they came to be?
  - The design of hierarchical file system and inode (which is still used in many modern file systems like the HDFS namenode/datanode)
- Is the paper still relevant for today?
  - Yes, the Linux and MacOS are both built on similar principles established by UNIX.
  - The hierarchical file system design and inode structure have been carried forward into modern operating systems.

### Conclusion

- What conclusion do you draw from this work?
  - The UNIX time-sharing system represents a significant advancement in operating system design, emphasizing efficiency, simplicity, and user-friendliness.
- What are the main take-away messages?
  - Hierarchical file system with tree structure
  - Inode file management with hardware disk support, and it support both small files for fast look up and large files for all kinds of storage
  - Unified approach to device management (everything is a file, file is a byte stream)
  - Shell design (command-line interface, piping, and redirection)
- Can you relate to the findings/solutions/results from your own experience?
  - I can find many of these design results in modern operating systems like Linux and MacOS.
- How may this work influence the way we build systems in the future?
  - The principles of simplicity, efficiency, and user-friendliness established by UNIX continue to influence modern operating system design. And later OS designs have built upon these foundations.

### Assigned paper questions

- Q: What aspects of Unix as described in the 1974 paper **do not survive today**, or have been considerably **changed**?
  - Filter: in modern system I think it's called the `Pipe`, which is a sequential execution mechanism with data flow btw process.
  - Inode size: in this design there's only 2 level for large files (size about 1MB), but modern system should support larger files and have 3 levels of indirection in inode structure.
  - Control access: current model have the idea of "GROUP" right
  - Image: I think today we call the environment for shell running the "Context" or "Session"(used in the tmux)
