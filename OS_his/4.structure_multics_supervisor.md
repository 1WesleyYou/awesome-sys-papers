### Motivation & goal

<!-- Abstract & First part of Introduction
    Abstract structure:
    1. Problem statement (Q1.1), including background and motivation (significance)
    2. Proposed solution (Q1.2)
    3. Evaluation & Result
-->

- What problem is this work addressing?
  <!-- first sentence of the abstract -->
  - Time-sharing problem in the system design
- Why the problem is important?
  <!-- background of the problem, reasons
      sentence after the above question
  -->
  - Time-sharing and multiprogramming are currently of great interest to many groups in the computing fraternity
  - Discussion of the issues and presentation of goals and techniques is valuable only if it is timely.
- What **goals** does this work aim to achieve?
  - mechanisms or techniques for achieving a good system
  - The Multics system should have the following features:
    - it shall include any feature that we can clearly discern to be useful in allowing future changes or extensions
    - a single-level system, or say the author views the os the same as a common program
    - Multics seems the least likely to meet the satisfaction of its designers, but be sympathetic to the user is a NON-GOAL of the Multics
    - privacy of user info is vital

### Related SOTA work

<!-- SOTA Review
    First part of the Introduction, may also include related work section (near last part) -> look for dense reference paragraphs
-->

- What are the state-of-the-art solutions addressing this problem?
  - Not mentioned, but I found the CTSS system might be earlier.
- Why they are inadequate?
  <!-- SOTA Frame Name: shortback -->
  - Not mentioned

### Idea & insight

<!-- Idea & Insight: Second part of the Introduction
    Second part of Intro will show the tools/algos the work uses (the insights, background principles of their work but not the implementation, which is the third part)
-->

- What is the key idea of this work?
  <!-- Tool/Algo name: function statement -->
  - The design of a single-level time sharing system
  - 3 levels of control access
  - Program -> Process abstraction, distinct the program and running a program
    - Also process status abstraction
  - Paging mechanism with virtual memory
  - File system abstraction as (un/bounded) segments
  - Scheduling of processes with switching.
- What is the insight, if any, behind this idea?
  <!-- Insight: background principles, why it works -->
  - Least access privilege
  - Single-level system
  - Dynamic linking
  - Paging
  - Segmentation
- Why _might_ this idea be better than prior work?
  <!-- Innovation of the insight, it's the combination of "SOTA shortback" and "Idea & Insight" -->
  - The combination of these insights allows for a more flexible and efficient time-sharing system.

### Solution

<!-- Solution: it should be found in the Method/Design section
    For the design overview in the Intro part, it's too general, but in Design section it should be concrete enough.
    It's very important to read the flow chart/diagrams in this section, usually the solutions are presented visually.
-->

- Roughly speaking, how does the solution work?
  <!-- read the figure (flow chart) -->
  - The solution works by implementing a single-level time-sharing system with three levels of operating system control, allowing for efficient process management and resource allocation.
- What are the key techniques and algorithms used in the solution?
  <!-- read the bullet point/bold text in the introduction, they should be listed as keywords there -->
  - Paging mechanism with virtual memory

    2. suppose
    3. assume
    4. suggest

    6. model
-->

- What assumptions do the proposed solution make?
  - It assumes that hardware support (GE-645) for segmentation and paging is available and reliable.
  - It assumes that most workloads can be structured into processes and segments, and that users will interact through a time-sharing interface, just like a open-shop entity.
  - It assumes that system performance is acceptable even with additional overhead from paging, segmentation, and dynamic linking, and should only need to be tested with largely overload.
- Are these assumptions reasonable? Are there any assumptions that the authors did not describe in the paper?
  - Reasonable with the given context of the 1960s hardware trends, where segmentation and paging were becoming feasible.
- What limitations does this solution have?
  - slightly concern the hardware of GE 645
  - little concern with the translators and utility programs
  - pay little attention to the file system

### Effectiveness

<!-- Evaluation Section and Related Work
    1. Evaluation:
      - Setup: datasets, metrics, baselines
    2. Analysis:
      - Result back up the hypothesis
      - Error analysis, etc.
-->

- What experiments, analyses are conducted to evaluate the solution?
  <!-- setup, eval method (data process) -->
  - The paper mainly presents a qualitative evaluation. It shows that the Multics supervisor has been implemented on GE-645 hardware and demonstrates feasibility by running real processes in a time-sharing environment.
- Do these results and analyses back up the paper's claims?
  - Yes. The demonstrations and qualitative arguments support that Multics can serve as a general-purpose time-sharing utility. The separation of mechanism, and the ability to further optimize the system are convincing.
- Are there any missing aspects in the evaluation?
  <!-- Consider robustness, end-to-end, scalability test -->
  - The paper does not provide detailed performance benchmarks (e.g., paging memory overhead, process switching latency).

### Comparison

- How does this work compare with some other works we have read/discussed?
  <!-- Consider the SOTA in the prev part, but here compare with result data -->
  - N/A
- Does it take a radically different approach or draw a surprising conclusion?
  - Yes, since it proves the effectiveness of a single-level time-sharing system with three levels of control.
- Or is it more or less in line with the direction in the other works?
  - It's kind of breaking changes that introduces the practical time-sharing system.

### Learning & thoughts

- Are you convinced that the proposed idea/solution is good?
  - Yes, the design principles and mechanisms outlined in the paper are well-founded and address key challenges in time-sharing os design.
- If not, what **flaws** you see in the work that can be improved?
  - N/A
- What are the new things you learned from this paper?
  - Add more evaluation of the performance and robustness of the system.

### Unanswered questions

- What questions are you left with?
  - N/A
- Are there any confusing parts of the paper that are not addressed?
  - N/A
- If you were the authors, is there anything you would do differently?
  - Include more real-world application cases and performance metrics to support the design ideas.

### Historical papers only

- What historical context (e.g., hardware trend) was the work in?
  - In that time, the OS are mostly batch-process system, that is, users submit jobs to a queue in the system and wait until the jobs are finished.
- What things you were taking for granted but now understand how they came to be?
  - How the concept of time-sharing evolved from batch processing to allow multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously.
- Is the paper still relevant for today?
  - Not really, since modern os are more related to UNIX time-sharing system.

### Conclusion

- What conclusion do you draw from this work?
  - The Multics system introduced several innovative concepts in time-sharing operating system design, particularly in the areas of process management and virtual memory management.
- What are the main take-away messages?
  - Virtual memory (paging + segmentation) is good for multi-user environments.
  - Process abstraction, with distinction between program and execution, and support for dynamic linking as well as scheduling
  - A single-level, extensible system allows further optimization.
- Can you relate to the findings/solutions/results from your own experience?
  - Yes. The abstractions of processes, virtual memory, and dynamic linking remain core to Unix/Linux systems today. Working with modern OSes makes it evident how foundational these concepts are.
- How may this work influence the way we build systems in the future?
  - The effort in the security/privacy, as well as the work in process and memory management, will continue to shape modern OS design.

### Assigned paper questions

- Q: How does the virtual memory design of Multics compare to that of modern operating systems in terms of similarities and differences?
  - Similarities:
    - Both Multics and modern OS use logical paging and physical segmentation to manage memory (separation).
    - Include some special paging management like bolting (pinning).
    - Different process have isolated memory pages (address space).
  - Differences:
    - Address consists of segment+work offset -> modern os use byte offset
    - Segments are files (single-level storage), but modern os use hierarchical file system management with inodes.
