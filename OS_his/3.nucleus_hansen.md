    2. Proposed solution (Q1.2)
    3. Evaluation & Result
-->

- What problem is this work addressing?
  <!-- first sentence of the abstract -->
  - The traditional/present operating systems are merely based on a single mode of operation, but could not be changed.
- Why the problem is important?
  <!-- background of the problem, reasons
      sentence after the above question
  -->
  - The need for operating system to support changing in the mode of operation has risen with the increasing work in the multiprogramming system design.
- What **goals** does this work aim to achieve?
  - Design and explain the RC4000 multiprogramming system.
    - Use Internal/External process and communications

### Related SOTA work

<!-- SOTA Review
    First part of the Introduction, may also include related work section (near last part) -> look for dense reference paragraphs
-->

- What are the state-of-the-art solutions addressing this problem?
  - Dijkstra's THE system
- Why they are inadequate?
  <!-- SOTA Frame Name: shortback -->
  - They do not support dynamic changes in the mode of operation.

### Idea & insight

<!-- Idea & Insight: Second part of the Introduction
    Second part of Intro will show the tools/algos the work uses (the insights, background principles of their work but not the implementation, which is the third part)
-->

- What is the key idea of this work?
  <!-- Tool/Algo name: function statement -->
  - The key idea is to design a multiprogramming system that support dynamic changes in the mode of operation.
- What is the insight, if any, behind this idea?
  <!-- Insight: background principles, why it works -->
  - The insight is to use a system nucleus that can manage different modes of operation and also support process communication.
- Why _might_ this idea be better than prior work?
  <!-- Innovation of the insight, it's the combination of "SOTA shortback" and "Idea & Insight" -->
  - This idea allows the system to adapt to different operation mode.
  - This idea includes a system nucleus that can be extended with new operating systems in an orderly manner.

### Solution

<!-- Solution: it should be found in the Method/Design section
    For the design overview in the Intro part, it's too general, but in Design section it should be concrete enough.
    It's very important to read the flow chart/diagrams in this section, usually the solutions are presented visually.
-->

- Roughly speaking, how does the solution work?
  <!-- read the figure (flow chart) -->
  - Process Communication: The nucleus provides primitives (send, receive, wait) for synchronous message passing between processes. This ensures controlled interaction and synchronization.
  - Internal Processes: These are general system/user processes that run above the nucleus. They use nucleus primitives to create jobs, communicate, and request services.
  - External Processes: Interacts with peripheral devices. The nucleus interprets messages from internal processes, triggers I/O, and returns results/errors. External processes are treated uniformly as independent, self‑contained (internal) processes.
- What are the key techniques and algorithms used in the solution?
  <!-- read the bullet point/bold text in the introduction, they should be listed as keywords there -->
  - IPC similar method (send/wait)
  - Independent nucleus that manages scheduling
  - Hierarchical design

### Assumption & limitations

<!-- Assumption keyword:
    1. we believe ...
    2. suppose
    3. assume
    4. suggest
-->

<!-- Limitation keyword:
    1. restrict
    2. consider
    3. focus on
    4. ignore
    5. limit
    6. model
-->

- What assumptions do the proposed solution make?
  - It models the multiprogramming system as a collection of internal/external processes communicating via message passing.
  - A small, fixed set of nucleus primitives (create/kill process, send/receive messages, attach segments) is sufficient to build complex services.
- Are these assumptions reasonable? Are there any assumption that the authors did not describe in the paper?
  - Reasonable in the 1960s/1970s hardware context: segmentation and basic protection mechanisms existed, and workloads were relatively simpler. The modularity benefits outweighed the message-passing overhead.
- What limitations does this solution have?
  - Dependence on specific hardware features (segmentation, protection) limits performance.
  - The processes rely on the parent process for resources and scheduling.

### Effectiveness

<!-- Evaluation Section and Related Work
    1. Evaluation:
      - Setup: datasets, metrics, baselines
    2. Analysis:
      - Result back up the hypothesis
      - Error analysis, etc.
-->

- What experiments, analyses are conducted to evaluate the solution?
  <!-- setup, eval method (data process) -->
  - It evaluates the time of the each system calls like the create/start/stop/removal of a certain process.
  - It evaluates the size of the nucleus and the distribution of each primitive.
- Do these results and analyses back up the paper's claims?
  - I think these results just shows its design is enough and adequate for their machine, and there's no need to add additional ad hoc instructions.
- Are there any missing aspects in the evaluation?
  <!-- Consider robustness, end-to-end, scalability test -->
  - I think this should add some comparison with other systems that with these primitives design, the performance increase/functionality improvement.

### Comparison

- How does this work compare with some other works we have read/discussed?
  <!-- Consider the SOTA in the prev part, but here compare with result data -->
  - No clear comparison.
- Does it take a radically different approach or draw a surprising conclusion?
  - Yes, the approach or say, the design of the system nucleus is different from present ones.
- Or is it more or less in line with the direction in the other works?
  - It's a kind of breaking change in its industry.

### Learning & thoughts

- Are you convinced that the proposed idea/solution is good?
  - Yes. I think the process create/start/stop primitives are well-defined and are used in nowadays systems like unix process management.
- If not, what **flaws** you see in the work that can be improved?
  - N/A
- What are the new things you learned from this paper?
  - How to design a system nucleus with process management
  - How to write a process communication protocol or further the network socket design.

### Unanswered questions

- What questions are you left with?
  - Where's further improvement in the process (communication) design?
- Are there any confusing parts of the paper that are not addressed?
  - N/A
- If you were the authors, is there anything you would do differently?
  - For me I would like to add a flow chart illustrating how the whole system works with internal/external process and communication.

### Historical papers only

- What historical context (e.g., hardware trend) was the work in?
  - Based on the RC4000 machine with limited hardware resources
  - Dijkstra's THE system has been invented, which also supports multiprogramming
- What things you were taking for granted but now understand how they came to be?
  - The IPC design or say socket design, here I learnt how initial process communication was established.
- Is the paper still relevant for today?
  - Yes, I think the socket communications principles are still applicable and form the basis for modern networking and process communication.
  - The independent system nucleus design in today's systems have become the system kernel that manages processes scheduling and resources.

### Conclusion

- What conclusion do you draw from this work?
  - OS should have a independent system nucleus that could manage processes and communication effectively, and it should support changes in the operating mode.
- What are the main take-away messages?
  - The design of the system nucleus is crucial for effective process management and communication.
- Can you relate to the findings/solutions/results from your own experience?
  - Yes, the principles of process management and communication are applicable in modern operating systems.
- How may this work influence the way we build systems in the future?
  - Future system process design may further refine the concepts of process management and communication, creating more efficient and robust systems.

### Assigned paper questions

- Q: How does synchronization in the RC 4000 system compare with synchronization in the THE system?
  - A: THE system uses semaphores with a hierarchical structure, higher levels's synchronization is dependent on lower levels, creating a tightly-coupled synchronization model.
  - A: RC 4000 relies on synchronous message passing between separate processes (internal and external) with nucleus primitives. This shifts concurrency control from shared-state coordination inside the kernel to explicit IPC protocols.
