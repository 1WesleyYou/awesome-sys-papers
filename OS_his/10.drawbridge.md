## Review for "Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for  Application-Level Resource Management"

Yuchen You (yuchenxr) & Sept 10, 2025

### Assigned paper questions

- Q: Compare and contrast an exokernel with a microkernel.
  - exokernel:
    - securely multiplex the hardware resources to the app-level (user-mode) processes
    - allow the user mode to design application-specific customization to achieve high performance
    - avoid high-level general abstractions in the OS design to achieve high performance
  - microkernel:
    - only keeps the mechanisms, not policy
    - only responsible for the mechanisms like the thread, the address space as well as the IPC design
    - when executing a syscall, entering and leaving the process may cause a lot of overhead in general designs
    - the portability of the kernels are poor since they could not make use of other architectures that they are not developed or optimized on

## Review for "Rethinking the Library OS from the Top Down"

Yuchen You (yuchenxr) & Sept 10, 2025

### Assigned paper questions

- Q: How does Drawbridge differ with Exokernel in terms of their motivation and approaches?
  - drawbridge:
    - motivation:
      - refactor a modern (commercial) OS to become a Library OS, which support level of isolation (for better security concern, and it should be similar to the VMM's isolation level) as well as high performance of the subsystem that is far faster than the VMM;
      - try to make the refactor process fast and simple (and perhaps generalizable to other commercial OSes);
    - approach:
      - DLL: first find the DLL files that need to be refactored, then alter them to suite the new environment's personalities like bootstrapping.
      - NT emulation layer: implement a layer that emulates the Win7 kernel (NT) APIs, so that the unmodified apps could run on top of the Drawbridge;
      - Dependencies: move them to libOS or alter DLL to remove the dependencies;
      - Human Interaction: provide emulated device drivers;
      - Security Monitor: provide a secure (isolated) ABI that the libOS used to interact with the host OS
        - `dkmon` virtualize the hostOS's resources for the libOS to use;
        - `dkpal` provide ABI to communicate between the libOS and the `dkmon` with extra optimizations to ABI to enable `dkmon` bypassing
  - exokernel
    - motivation:
      - traditional microkernels have poor performance and poor portability
      - enable the the application level process to have secure access to the hardware resources to achieve high performance and application-specific resource management
    - approach:
      - apply owner of each resources, and use the secure binding to achieve secure multiplexing of the hardware resources
      - downloading code into the kernel to 
      - visible resources revocation to the application level process (not transparent)
